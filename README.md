# Page `N` of 365

I'll be listening to 365 new albums on this 2019.  
The Album doesn't have to be recent, just new to me.

## January

1. [Misfits - Walk Among Us](https://www.last.fm/music/Misfits/Walk+Among+Us)
    
    This is my first time listening to Misfits, I'm more a Heavy Metal guy than a Punk one. But I really like them, I'll definitely listen to them again on this list, but not tomorrow, I'll try to make it diverse.

2. [Kanye West - Ye](https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Ye)

    I would say that I didn't want to listen to this album when it came out, I just thought that the phrase "I hate being bi-polar, it's awesome" sounds like a dumb thing a teenager would say, and I still think the same, but holy God, the album was really good, not as good as the _classic_ albums from Kanye, but I was really good, considering the fact that I don't like that much his recent works and _Kids See Ghost_ sounds boring to me.
    
    The only issue I have with **Ye** is the length of the album, it was too short, but I guess that's better than adding filler to it. Short or not the album was good, though.
