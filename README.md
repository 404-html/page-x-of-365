# Page `x` of 365

I'll be listening to 365 new albums on this 2019.  
The Album doesn't have to be recent, just new to me.

## January

1. [Misfits - Walk Among Us](https://www.last.fm/music/Misfits/Walk+Among+Us)

    This is my first time listening to Misfits, I'm more a Heavy Metal guy than a Punk one. But I really like them, I'll definitely listen to them again on this list, but not tomorrow, I'll try to make it diverse.

2. [Kanye West - Ye](https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Ye)

    I would say that I didn't want to listen to this album when it came out, I just thought that the phrase "I hate being bi-polar, it's awesome" sounds like a dumb thing a teenager would say, and I still think the same, but holy God, the album was really good, not as good as the _classic_ albums from Kanye, but I was really good, considering the fact that I don't like that much his recent works and _Kids See Ghost_ sounds boring to me.

    The only issue I have with **Ye** is the length of the album, it was too short, but I guess that's better than adding filler to it. Short or not the album was good, though.

3. [Carpathian Forest - Morbid Fascination of Death](https://www.last.fm/music/Carpathian+Forest/Morbid+Fascination+of+Death)

    Again, this is a band I didn't listen before, even though I knew they exist and beside the fact that I enjoy norwegian black metal, I never had the chance to listen to them.

    I was confused because I thought this was an album from early 90's when I was listening to it, but after I read about it and discover that it's from 2001 I was surprised. I liked the sound because it felt raw (like early 90's BM) but it didn't have much distortion, just the right amount, also I liked the saxophone, I never expected it so it was a nice surprise.

    My only issue is that the album didn't feel homogeneous, I think it was because some songs are re-releases from early EPs when they had a different style, but I'll have to listen to their earlier works to see if that's the case.

    The album cover is really bad, it seems like the work from a high school student who just discovered Photoshop.

4. [System of a Down - Toxicity](https://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/Toxicity)

    I had to listen to it in mono because stereo was too annoying. Not a fan.

5. [The Sugarhill Gang - The Sugarhill Gang](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sugarhill+Gang/The+Sugarhill+Gang+-+30th+Anniversary+Edition+(Expanded+Version))

    All the upbeat songs from the album were build around Rapper's Delight, which would be great, in theory, because I love that song.

    But it's not, is not great, there's no point in listen to the album if the whole "theme" is giving context or sound like Rapper's Delight, in that case I would prefer to listen to that song on loop and I would enjoy it more.

6. [Bad Bunny - X 100PRE](https://www.last.fm/music/Bad%20Bunny/X%20100PRE)

    This album is surprisingly good, considering the fact that most of reggaeton/trap artist focus only on releasing singles with the intention to become the next banger of the moment.

    The whole album felt homogeneous with some satisfying rhythm changes here and there, I love the sythwave tunes at _Otra Noche En Miami_ and the bachata guitar on _La Romana_.

    I really don't give much attention to lyrics, but I would say this a more "human" version of Bad Bunny, he sings more about personal stuff than the typical fully explicit kind of music he does. He went in a good direction with this.

7. [Tool - Lateralus](https://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Lateralus)

    This record can be a little difficult to review because of its length, I had some issues with the album because of the influences from Nu Metal, which is a genre I don't like. But overall it was a good experience.

    The only song I didn't like was _"Ticks and Leeches"_, and I didn't like the silent ending of _"Triad"_, I know it was a build for the ending, but it was too much silent time. The ending was awesome, I felt scared, I felt anxious, and I don't know why but it remind me of _"I Was A Prisoner In Your Skull"_ from Swans, you get immersed on the narrative with both songs. I'll listen more stuff from them.

8. [Aphex Twin - ...I Care Because You Do](https://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin/...I+Care+Because+You+Do)

    Really love the balance on this album, it felt so peaceful and harmonious and yet so intriguing and threatening, even the noisy part fit so perfectly. Not much else to say, it was good and I'll definitely listen to it regurarly.

9. [ESPRIT 空想 - 200% Electronica](https://www.last.fm/music/ESPRIT+%E7%A9%BA%E6%83%B3/200%25+Electronica)

    I can't remember the last time I listened to a Vaporwave album so good. I mean, I love vaporwave, but I have to admit that most of songs from most artist sound kinda the same (which is the best if you like the genre). **and this album is not the exception**, but still it felt more soundtrack-y than most of vaporwave songs, which I liked becuase it felt more light and easy to listen.

    But yeah, this will one more of my to-go vaporwave albums.

10. [Tatsuro Yamashita - For You](https://www.last.fm/music/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%8B%E9%81%94%E9%83%8E/FOR+YOU)

    Contiuning from the aesthetic feel of vapowave, I decided to listen to some japanese 80's music. It was the best experience while driving in the city. It was the best _City Pop_ album I had listened to date.

11. [Travi$ Scott - ASTROWORLD](https://www.last.fm/music/Travi$+Scott/ASTROWORLD)

    I never had the chance to listen to Travi$ Scott, I really enjoyed the album, the **SICKO MODE** song is a total hit, but the rest of the album is pretty good also. I'll definitely listen to his previous albums too.

12. [Have a Nice Life - The Unnatural World](https://www.last.fm/music/Have+a+Nice+Life/The+Unnatural+World)

    **Arrowheads (x76)**

    I liked this album more than Deathconsciousness, it's more post-rock an doesn't break the aura, I felt Deathconsciousness was too experimental for my taste.

13. [50 Cent - Get Rich Or Die Tryin'](https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/Get+Rich+Or+Die+Tryin%27)

    Back in the day 50 Cent was everywhere, he was the face of hip-hop, I like his songs, he had good bangers, but I never tried to listen to a whole album by him. And I'm glad that I did, this album was good from the start to end, I has all the hits that I remember from him, but the songs that I haven't listened are equally good.

    This is a perfect album for working out, also. It will be one of my to-go gym albums.

14. [HOLY FAWN - DEATH SPELLS](https://www.last.fm/music/HOLY+FAWN/DEATH+SPELLS)

    Cold, warm, harsh, tender. I listened to it while driving on drizzly afternoon along a lonely highway, I don't think there's a better occasion to listen to it.

15. [Breakbot - By Your Side](https://www.last.fm/music/Breakbot/By+Your+Side)

    I found this album looking for some good French House album, I listened to him because album looked familiar, I knew I had seen that artwork somewhere, and for my surprise this was the album from where "that" song is (Baby I'm Yours).

    Is a nice album, a blend of many genres who fit so well together. It's far from the sound I expected, I was looking for something more Like DANGER or Kavinsky, but it was a nice surprise.

    Even though, I can't say I like every songs the same way, because almost all of them have their own style, but overall I liked the album and is something I would easily listen while working or driving.

16. [The walters - Songs for Dads](https://www.last.fm/music/The+walters/Songs+for+Dads)

    Oh, the modern-retro style was wonderful, even if it's just an EP it deserves praise. I also liked the manga-styled cover, (it's worth to mention). It gave me an itch for The Beach Boy music, but I will stick my neck out and say I like this more than them.

17. [Los Prisioneros - Corazones](https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Prisioneros/Corazones)

    "Tren Al Sur" and "Estrechez De Corazón" are anachronic hits from latin american rock, maybe all of you will agree with me that either (or both) songs deserve a spot in the top 10 of spanish rock music from all time.

    But damn, "that rap song" was trash, it ruined the album for me, I didn't have a good experience listening to it, also because many songs from the album felt subpar, maybe because those two hits overshadow the rest. But I don't think I will ever listen to this album again. Ok, "Noche en la ciudad" had good sound and lyrics, but beside that nothing else is redeemable.

18. [Moe Shop - Pure Pure](https://www.last.fm/music/Moe+Shop/Pure+Pure)

    I'm glad how Moe Shop's sound have evolved, from this album to the recent releases there's a lot of difference, and I like more the new sound, not that I didn't like this album, but today's tracks sound so much better. There's nothing much to say, the album is still ok.

19. [Vision Divine - Vision Divine](https://www.last.fm/music/Vision+Divine/Vision+Divine)

    I had almost 10 years (I think) since the last time I listened to Vision Divine. I'll admit that I just listened to them the first time because of their _Take On Me_ cover, and I almost choose that album _(Send me an Angel)_ to review, but when I was listening the songs I realized I had already listened to it many years ago, then I choosed to review this one.

    The sound is amazing, is what you expect and what you want from a Power Metal band, Fabio Lione's voice is impeccable, did I told you that Rhapsody was the first Power Metal band I ever listened?, so yeah, I was pretty nostalgic while listening to this album. What I liked the most is that there's no weak tracks, all of them are full blasting powerfull metal songs (just until the end but that's forgivable at that point).

    Also I love the cover, angels and Power Metal goes pretty well, actually I prefer song singing about the end of the days and religious mythologies than generic medieval fantasies.

    I'll definitelly continue listening their whole discography (I think I had listened to more albums from them, I'll double check), expect more.

20. [BROCKHAMPTON - SATURATION](https://www.last.fm/music/BROCKHAMPTON/SATURATION)

    I'm trying to get into BROCKHAMPTON and I'll listen their albums chronologically, people say SATURATION II is the best one, but I don't want to start there because if it is really the best one, then everything will go downhill from there, right?

    So yeah, the album is pretty catchy, it has some strong violent tracks, some other softer ballad-like rap songs, but all of them have good beats, it's great not a single one catched my attention at being bad, I liked the diversity of sounds, it has a very wide range of moods and tempos, and that was expected considering the amount of artist working on the album. I want to listen to it more before getting into the next one, but I hope to listen all of their albums and include them on this list. To Be Continued.

21. [The Brecker Brothers - The Brecker Bros](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Brecker+Brothers/The+Brecker+Bros)

    I love this album, this is the kind of jazz that I digg, it has a funky sound that give it so much energy, there are some parts more funky than jazzy and that gives you a sensation of going side to side, up and down, Marco to Polo (if you know what I mean, because I don't), there's only one slow song and one with lyrics, both still fit well in the album because they give you some sort of break from the rest of the album, you cannot listen to it without feeling pumped.

    I does kinda sound like a soundtrack, but I don't think that's a bad thing.

22. [Eminem - The Eminem Show](https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Eminem+Show)

    Ok, I never liked Eminem and I don't know why I thougth this time would be different.  
    I guess the album is ok, but I'm too biased. I would pick another album to review if I had the time, but I can't say much about this, I just didn't like it.

23. [Weezer - Teal Album](https://www.last.fm/music/Weezer/Weezer%20(Teal%20Album))

    Hey, this album came out of nowhere, and it's so good that I want to review it. And yes, I think it's good just because is a covers album from 60-70-80-90's songs which everyone (I mean EVERYONE) love.

    I think that they should have included _Rosanna_ from Toto and _Android Paranoid_ from Radiohead to the list, and _No Scrubs_ kinda doesn't fit with the other songs. I would say even _Paranoid_ doesn't fit, but hey, the final result is really nice. There are songs which I like how they sound in this cover version more than the original ones, _Sweet Dreams_ and _Stand by Me_ for instance. As opposite to that, I think their version of _Africa_ isn't as faithful to the original as I would like, maybe I'm just too purist when it comes to covers.

    Overall the album is really good, but still I'll skip _No Scrubs_ and _Paranoid_ when I listen to this album, just because they don't fit at much in this list as the rest.

24. [Immortal - Northern Chaos Gods](https://www.last.fm/music/Immortal/Northern+Chaos+Gods)

    Even though I miss Abbath on the vocals this is a really great album, it have all the elements that I love from Immortal, it's so cold, so dark, so raw yet melodic, it's much better than their last work, a great comeback, let's hope we don't have to wait another 9 years for a new album.

25. [Electric Light Orchestra - A New World Record](https://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Light+Orchestra/A+New+World+Record)

    This album is so good that now I want it on physical form, what else can I say?

    Everybody knows _Telephone Line_ and _Livin' Thing_, but all the songs from this album are equally good, the only downside is that it's too short, I listened to it 5 times before switching to other album.

    Shangri-La is the perfect ending, one of the best I had ever listen.

26. [Brand New - Science Fiction](https://www.last.fm/music/Brand+New/Science+Fiction)

    I had mixed feelings about this albums, it have great songs, like _Same Logic / Teeth_ which ironically follow after the song I least like, _Could Never Be Heaven_, most of the songs at the end are very forgettable.

    I probably will still listen to it a few more times until I get bored of it, so yeah.

27. [Brand New - Science Fiction](https://www.last.fm/music/Brand+New/Science+Fiction)

    I had mixed feelings about this albums, it have great songs, like _Same Logic / Teeth_ which ironically follow after the song I least like, _Could Never Be Heaven_, most of the songs at the end are very forgettable.

    I probably will still listen to it a few more times until I get bored of it, so yeah.

28. [Earl Sweatshirt - Some Rap Songs](https://www.last.fm/music/Earl+Sweatshirt/Some+Rap+Songs)

    I have to admit this album is something you can't digest in a single day, I listened to it four or five times and I'm not sure how to interpret it, the songs aren't bad, some of them are catchy and pretty chill, but still I have to listen to it more to form an opinion.

29. [(Sandy) Alex G - Rocket](https://www.last.fm/music/(Sandy)+Alex+G/Rocket)

    I like this album a lot, it mixes so many genres together: country, jazz, psychedelic rock, poppy melodies, and even if the rhythm changes from one song to the next one it feels so homogeneous, you don't notice the change, it's like a playlist of your favorite songs from every genre but put together in a way they don't collide with each other and keep the harmony. I'm glad albums like this exists.

30. [Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy](https://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest/Twin+Fantasy)

    I know this album has a lot of cult following online, so before listen to it I expected it to be good, and it really is. Musically it has a great sound and production, and lirically is one of the most deep albums I have listen on this year (maybe the best).

    I don't care if the remake or the original is better, the message is what matters on this album. And I should say, this is not the kind of albums that I listen to, but I'm surprised of the music quality and the message this album delivers.

    Maybe I'll listen to more albums from this band. And if I do, I'll definitely listen to _Teens Of Denial_ next.

31. [Amon Amarth - Deceiver of the Gods](https://www.last.fm/music/Amon+Amarth/Deceiver+of+the+Gods)

    This album has everything I love from Amon Amarth, is strong, epic and with some melodic touches, just like a storm blasting through your ears.

    The song _Hel_ adds a nice touch with Messiah Marcolin vocals to the already know style of Amon Amarth, the only thing that I felt odd from this album was the solo at the end of _Coming of the Tide_, is not that it's bad or something, it just sounds too misplaced from the rest of the song (or the album).

    The closing is one of the best song in the album, it's the perfect ending that fills you with energy and make you want to play the album again or listen to other records from this great band.


## February

32. [Green Day - Dookie](https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Dookie)

    So, today is the 25th anniversary of this album, and I have to admit I didn't listen to it until now. And it was good, it has the standard Green Day sound and I felt it gets way better after _Basket Case_ you can feel the before and after from that point, there are a couple of song that I already knew, and I feel good about it because I wasn't missing much from this album, from the second half (Basket Case onwards) I just didn't knew one song (excluding the ending), so I was pretty happy to finally know the context from all of them, and for the fact that I knew a good amount of songs already.

    So yeah, I finally listened to this album and I enjoyed it, maybe I'll listen to more Green Day albums in a near future.

33. [AJJ - The Bible 2](https://www.last.fm/music/ajj/The+Bible+2)

    I tried to listen to this album bebore Green Day's one, "maybe I should listen more from it to actually like it", I said to myself. But no, I didn't like it, it's too boring for me.

34. [Avantasia - Ghostlights](https://www.last.fm/music/Avantasia/Ghostlights)

    Avantasia has some really great albums, I know all the collaborations and effort put on their album lend us to put big expectations for their quality. By no means this album is bad, but I feel it doesn't hold up really well in comparison to their other albums, it's a great Power Metal album, but not one of the best from Avantasia.

    Every other Avantasia (and you can say this about every Power Metal album), has build-up songs and full blasting energy songs, and you know the build ups are necessary to make emphasis on the blasting songs. But I feel this album is just build ups, and no energy, it feels lacking, maybe I should listen to it more to really appreciate it, or maybe is just not the kind of albums I like. It's still pretty good though.

35. [Candy Claws - Two Airships / Exploder Falls](https://www.last.fm/music/Candy+Claws/Two+Airships+%2F+Exploder+Falls)

    This album is certainly one of the craziest I had listen so far from this list, and even if it's very different from the rest of Candy Claws' albums, I enjoyed it a lot, it's still cozy as the rest, but more experimental, electronic and almost psychedelic.

36. [Justice - Woman](https://www.last.fm/music/Justice/Woman)

    Even if _Cross_ is one of my favorite albums from all times, I have to admit I haven't listen to this album yet, and that was because _Audio, Video, Disco_ felt so bad (I can't say if it's just bad in comparison to Cross or in general). But this album is really great, it's more diverse than _Cross_ but it keeps the essence of the band (or duo if you want to get technical) a great album to listen non-stop while driving or working or just to chill out.

    What else can I say? I love this album. I want a physical copy already.

37. [Hypocrisy - Abducted](https://www.last.fm/music/Hypocrisy/Abducted)

    This album is pure gold, I love it, one of the best Death Metal album I had ever listen to. Slow and harsh, with spasms of brutality all over it. Before this I had only listen to _10 Years of Chaos and Confusion_ but with this I'll listen to more albums from Hypocrisy.

38. [Erasure - I Say I Say I Say](https://www.last.fm/music/Erasure/I+Say+I+Say+I+Say)

    I have been obsessed with _Always_ for a couple of weeks, so I decided to listen to the whole album. Surprisingly that's the song that fits less among the others, even though is a good album, pretty solid music and style, not a single bad song. I have to admit it's not my kind of music (even with my obsession with _that song_), but still a good album.

    I can listen to this album while working when I need to concentrate on what I'm doing instead of the music. The lack of commas on the title bothers me.

39. [Sleeping at Last - Atlas: Space (Deluxe)](https://www.last.fm/music/Sleeping+at+Last/Atlas:+Space+(Deluxe))

    Explaining this album's tracklist is a little bit complicated, so here's an explaination taken from [genius.com](https://genius.com/albums/Sleeping-at-last/Atlas-space-deluxe):

    > Atlas: Space Deluxe is a compilation of Sleeping at Last’s two space-themed _[EPs: Atlas: Space 1](https://genius.com/albums/Sleeping-at-last/Atlas-space-1)_ and _[Atlas: Space 2](https://genius.com/albums/Sleeping-at-last/Atlas-space-2)_. The tracks from both EPs have been previously released together in _[Atlas: Year One](https://genius.com/albums/Sleeping-at-last/Atlas-year-one)_, but had not been packaged together as a separate entity before *Space: Deluxe.* The deluxe album also includes an instrumental for each main track.

    I love the fact that this compilation has all the tracks on intrumental version, you can see a difference listening to both versions. The music is already pretty ambient, so when you listen to the track without vocals you can see each song holds up pretty well in that way. I loved the thematic for the album also, I'll also check the other tracks from the _Atlas: Year One_ compilation I hope they're good as well.

40. [Takako Minekawa - Roomic Cube](https://www.last.fm/music/%E5%B6%BA%E5%B7%9D%E8%B2%B4%E5%AD%90/Roomic+Cube)

    This album is so experimental as it can be. It's so chaotic yet so well planned, even if all songs sound different, they all complement each other. It was fun to listen to it.

41. [His Name Is Alive - Stars on E.S.P.](https://www.last.fm/music/His+Name+Is+Alive/Stars+on+E.S.P.)

    I feel bad for not listening to this band before, I love the sound from this album, is the perfect soundtrack for coming back from the beach on the afternoon when the shadow from the trees are already stretching. 
    
    It has a lighthearted sound, like some cute pop songs but mixed with shoegaze-y distortion and guitars that remind you of _The Beach Boys_. I hate to compare it with way more recent bands, but it's the perfect balance between _KKB_ and _Candy Claws_ (Don't hate at me, I love those two bands).
    
    I really don't know if their other albums sound similar, because this is my fisrt time listen to this band, but I hope they do.

42. [Anamanaguchi - Power Supply](https://www.last.fm/music/Anamanaguchi/Power+Supply)

    Hey, the first EP from Anamanaguchi is pretty, I would say it's better than their first album. Sadly the record quality of the version I listen to was not that good, I don't know if there's any remaster for this album and if there isn't it should.


43. [Stormlord - Mare Nostrum](https://www.last.fm/music/Stormlord/Mare+Nostrum)

    I loved this album and I'm glad to discover this band, there's been a while since the last time I listened to a "new" metal band that I want to keep on listening, and this is definitelly one.

    I know they aren't from the same country or genre, but _Stormlord_ reminds me _Wintersun_ a lot, or at least they give me the same feeling while listen to them. Their music gives you an extravagant epic feeling ("epic" as the classical meaning), but keeping the dark aura of Black Metal.

    The album isn't perfect though, there's one song I just didn't like, which is my only issue with the album. _The Castaway_ just felt boring, its' a really skippable song, but beside that the album was really good.

44. [ABBA - Voulez-Vous](https://www.last.fm/music/ABBA/Voulez-Vous)

    Every song from this album is a banger, this is not a surprise coming from ABBA, a couple of their top greatest hits are from this album, but they don't shadow the other tracks, every song its good by their own merits.

45. [Various Artists - Yellow Loveless](https://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Yellow+Loveless)

    It's Valentine and I've been waiting to listen this album on this day, _Loveless_ might be my favorite album from all time, so for me this is something important.

    The album mixes different genres, some songs follow the shoegaze style from the original album, other ones are more derivative. My only issue is that the songs with different styles are mostly at the beginning of the album, and that make you think the whole album is equally diverse, but no, most of the other covers follow the band's style, but I would say they're okay at best.

    Definitely the best cover from the album is _When You Sleep_ by _Shonen Knife_, I have to admit I like more this version than the original, I would recommend this cover album only for that song.
<<<<<<< HEAD

46. [Wire - 154](https://www.last.fm/music/Wire/154)

    Well, I can't say I liked this album, neither I disliked it, it was pretty neutral to me. There were some songs that catched my attention, _A Touching Display_, _On Returning_ and _Map Ref. 41°N 93°W_ were good, also _Indirect Enquiries_ was interesting, beside that the album was very forgettable to me, maybe post-punk it's not my kind of thing.

47. [Shakira - Pies Descalzos](https://www.last.fm/music/Shakira/Pies+Descalzos)

    I wanted to review this album long ago but I never could because I just switched to _(¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?)[https://www.last.fm/music/Shakira/%C2%BFD%C3%B3nde+Est%C3%A1n+los+Ladrones%3F]_ at the middle of the album, not that this album is bad, but that other is just perfect.

    So, I already knew almost all of the the songs from this album, because Shakira was really popular back in the day (and still she is), but listening to the album as a whole gives you a better look of the production, it's a pop album, it's catchy and it's well done, every song fit its place but they aren't related between them, so you can shuffle it and still enjoy the same way. So yeah, this album is good but still _¿Dónde Están los Ladrones?_ is her best album ever.
