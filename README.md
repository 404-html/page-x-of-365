# Page `N` of 365

I'll be listening to 365 new albums on this 2019.  
The Album doesn't have to be recent, just new to me.

## January

1. [Misfits - Walk Among Us](https://www.last.fm/music/Misfits/Walk+Among+Us)

    This is my first time listening to Misfits, I'm more a Heavy Metal guy than a Punk one. But I really like them, I'll definitely listen to them again on this list, but not tomorrow, I'll try to make it diverse.

2. [Kanye West - Ye](https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Ye)

    I would say that I didn't want to listen to this album when it came out, I just thought that the phrase "I hate being bi-polar, it's awesome" sounds like a dumb thing a teenager would say, and I still think the same, but holy God, the album was really good, not as good as the _classic_ albums from Kanye, but I was really good, considering the fact that I don't like that much his recent works and _Kids See Ghost_ sounds boring to me.

    The only issue I have with **Ye** is the length of the album, it was too short, but I guess that's better than adding filler to it. Short or not the album was good, though.

3. [Carpathian Forest - Morbid Fascination of Death](https://www.last.fm/music/Carpathian+Forest/Morbid+Fascination+of+Death)

    Again, this is a band I didn't listen before, even though I knew they exist and beside the fact that I enjoy norwegian black metal, I never had the chance to listen to them.

    I was confused because I thought this was an album from early 90's when I was listening to it, but after I read about it and discover that it's from 2001 I was surprised. I liked the sound because it felt raw (like early 90's BM) but it didn't have much distortion, just the right amount, also I liked the saxophone, I never expected it so it was a nice surprise.

    My only issue is that the album didn't feel homogeneous, I think it was because some songs are re-releases from early EPs when they had a different style, but I'll have to listen to their earlier works to see if that's the case.

    The album cover is really bad, it seems like the work from a high school student who just discovered Photoshop.
