# Page `N` of 365

I'll be listening to 365 new albums on this 2019.  
The Album doesn't have to be recent, just new to me.

## January

1. [Misfits - Walk Among Us](https://www.last.fm/music/Misfits/Walk+Among+Us)

    This is my first time listening to Misfits, I'm more a Heavy Metal guy than a Punk one. But I really like them, I'll definitely listen to them again on this list, but not tomorrow, I'll try to make it diverse.

2. [Kanye West - Ye](https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Ye)

    I would say that I didn't want to listen to this album when it came out, I just thought that the phrase "I hate being bi-polar, it's awesome" sounds like a dumb thing a teenager would say, and I still think the same, but holy God, the album was really good, not as good as the _classic_ albums from Kanye, but I was really good, considering the fact that I don't like that much his recent works and _Kids See Ghost_ sounds boring to me.

    The only issue I have with **Ye** is the length of the album, it was too short, but I guess that's better than adding filler to it. Short or not the album was good, though.

3. [Carpathian Forest - Morbid Fascination of Death](https://www.last.fm/music/Carpathian+Forest/Morbid+Fascination+of+Death)

    Again, this is a band I didn't listen before, even though I knew they exist and beside the fact that I enjoy norwegian black metal, I never had the chance to listen to them.

    I was confused because I thought this was an album from early 90's when I was listening to it, but after I read about it and discover that it's from 2001 I was surprised. I liked the sound because it felt raw (like early 90's BM) but it didn't have much distortion, just the right amount, also I liked the saxophone, I never expected it so it was a nice surprise.

    My only issue is that the album didn't feel homogeneous, I think it was because some songs are re-releases from early EPs when they had a different style, but I'll have to listen to their earlier works to see if that's the case.

    The album cover is really bad, it seems like the work from a high school student who just discovered Photoshop.

4. [System of a Down - Toxicity](https://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/Toxicity)

    I had to listen to it in mono because stereo was too annoying. Not a fan.
    
5. [The Sugarhill Gang - The Sugarhill Gang](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sugarhill+Gang/The+Sugarhill+Gang+-+30th+Anniversary+Edition+(Expanded+Version))

    All the upbeat songs from the album were build around Rapper's Delight, which would be great, in theory, because I love that song.
    
    But it's not, is not great, there's no point in listen to the album if the whole "theme" is giving context or sound like Rapper's Delight, in that case I would prefer to listen to that song on loop and I would enjoy it more.
