# Page `x` of 365

I'll be listening to 365 new albums on this 2019.  
The Album doesn't have to be recent, just new to me.

## January

1. [Misfits - Walk Among Us](https://www.last.fm/music/Misfits/Walk+Among+Us)

    This is my first time listening to Misfits, I'm more a Heavy Metal guy than a Punk one. But I really like them, I'll definitely listen to them again on this list, but not tomorrow, I'll try to make it diverse.

2. [Kanye West - Ye](https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Ye)

    I would say that I didn't want to listen to this album when it came out, I just thought that the phrase "I hate being bi-polar, it's awesome" sounds like a dumb thing a teenager would say, and I still think the same, but holy God, the album was really good, not as good as the _classic_ albums from Kanye, but I was really good, considering the fact that I don't like that much his recent works and _Kids See Ghost_ sounds boring to me.

    The only issue I have with **Ye** is the length of the album, it was too short, but I guess that's better than adding filler to it. Short or not the album was good, though.

3. [Carpathian Forest - Morbid Fascination of Death](https://www.last.fm/music/Carpathian+Forest/Morbid+Fascination+of+Death)

    Again, this is a band I didn't listen before, even though I knew they exist and beside the fact that I enjoy norwegian black metal, I never had the chance to listen to them.

    I was confused because I thought this was an album from early 90's when I was listening to it, but after I read about it and discover that it's from 2001 I was surprised. I liked the sound because it felt raw (like early 90's BM) but it didn't have much distortion, just the right amount, also I liked the saxophone, I never expected it so it was a nice surprise.

    My only issue is that the album didn't feel homogeneous, I think it was because some songs are re-releases from early EPs when they had a different style, but I'll have to listen to their earlier works to see if that's the case.

    The album cover is really bad, it seems like the work from a high school student who just discovered Photoshop.

4. [System of a Down - Toxicity](https://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/Toxicity)

    I had to listen to it in mono because stereo was too annoying. Not a fan.
    
5. [The Sugarhill Gang - The Sugarhill Gang](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Sugarhill+Gang/The+Sugarhill+Gang+-+30th+Anniversary+Edition+(Expanded+Version))

    All the upbeat songs from the album were build around Rapper's Delight, which would be great, in theory, because I love that song.
    
    But it's not, is not great, there's no point in listen to the album if the whole "theme" is giving context or sound like Rapper's Delight, in that case I would prefer to listen to that song on loop and I would enjoy it more.

6. [Bad Bunny - X 100PRE](https://www.last.fm/music/Bad%20Bunny/X%20100PRE)

    This album is surprisingly good, considering the fact that most of reggaeton/trap artist focus only on releasing singles with the intention to become the next banger of the moment.
    
    The whole album felt homogeneous with some satisfying rhythm changes here and there, I love the sythwave tunes at _Otra Noche En Miami_ and the bachata guitar on _La Romana_.
    
    I really don't give much attention to lyrics, but I would say this a more "human" version of Bad Bunny, he sings more about personal stuff than the typical fully explicit kind of music he does. He went in a good direction with this.

7. [Tool - Lateralus](https://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Lateralus)

    This record can be a little difficult to review because of its length, I had some issues with the album because of the influences from Nu Metal, which is a genre I don't like. But overall it was a good experience.
    
    The only song I didn't like was _"Ticks and Leeches"_, and I didn't like the silent ending of _"Triad"_, I know it was a build for the ending, but it was too much silent time. The ending was awesome, I felt scared, I felt anxious, and I don't know why but it remind me of _"I Was A Prisoner In Your Skull"_ from Swans, you get immersed on the narrative with both songs. I'll listen more stuff from them.

8. [Aphex Twin - ...I Care Because You Do](https://www.last.fm/music/Aphex+Twin/...I+Care+Because+You+Do)

    Really love the balance on this album, it felt so peaceful and harmonious and yet so intriguing and threatening, even the noisy part fit so perfectly. Not much else to say, it was good and I'll definitely listen to it regurarly.

9. [ESPRIT 空想 - 200% Electronica](https://www.last.fm/music/ESPRIT+%E7%A9%BA%E6%83%B3/200%25+Electronica)

    I can't remember the last time I listened to a Vaporwave album so good. I mean, I love vaporwave, but I have to admit that most of songs from most artist sound kinda the same (which is the best if you like the genre). **and this album is not the exception**, but still it felt more soundtrack-y than most of vaporwave songs, which I liked becuase it felt more light and easy to listen.

    But yeah, this will one more of my to-go vaporwave albums.

10. [Tatsuro Yamashita - For You](https://www.last.fm/music/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%8B%E9%81%94%E9%83%8E/FOR+YOU)

    Contiuning from the aesthetic feel of vapowave, I decided to listen to some japanese 80's music. It was the best experience while driving in the city. It was the best _City Pop_ album I had listened to date.

11. [Travi$ Scott - ASTROWORLD](https://www.last.fm/music/Travi$+Scott/ASTROWORLD)

    I never had the chance to listen to Travi$ Scott, I really enjoyed the album, the **SICKO MODE** song is a total hit, but the rest of the album is pretty good also. I'll definitely listen to his previous albums too.

12. [Have a Nice Life - The Unnatural World](https://www.last.fm/music/Have+a+Nice+Life/The+Unnatural+World)

    **Arrowheads (x76)**

    I liked this album more than Deathconsciousness, it's more post-rock an doesn't break the aura, I felt Deathconsciousness was too experimental for my taste.

13. [50 Cent - Get Rich Or Die Tryin'](https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/Get+Rich+Or+Die+Tryin%27)

    Back in the day 50 Cent was everywhere, he was the face of hip-hop, I like his songs, he had good bangers, but I never tried to listen to a whole album by him. And I'm glad that I did, this album was good from the start to end, I has all the hits that I remember from him, but the songs that I haven't listened are equally good.

    This is a perfect album for working out, also. It will be one of my to-go gym albums.

14. [HOLY FAWN - DEATH SPELLS](https://www.last.fm/music/HOLY+FAWN/DEATH+SPELLS)

    Cold, warm, harsh, tender. I listened to it while driving on drizzly afternoon along a lonely highway, I don't think there's a better occasion to listen to it.

15. [Breakbot - By Your Side](https://www.last.fm/music/Breakbot/By+Your+Side)

    I found this album looking for some good French House album, I listened to him because album looked familiar, I knew I had seen that artwork somewhere, and for my surprise this was the album from where "that" song is (Baby I'm Yours).

    Is a nice album, a blend of many genres who fit so well together. It's far from the sound I expected, I was looking for something more Like DANGER or Kavinsky, but it was a nice surprise. 
    
    Even though, I can't say I like every songs the same way, because almost all of them have their own style, but overall I liked the album and is something I would easily listen while working or driving.

16. [The walters - Songs for Dads](https://www.last.fm/music/The+walters/Songs+for+Dads)

    Oh, the modern-retro style was wonderful, even if it's just an EP it deserves praise. I also liked the manga-styled cover, (it's worth to mention). It gave me an itch for The Beach Boy music, but I will stick my neck out and say I like this more than them.

17. [The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds)

    So, scratching my itch for Beach Boys I finally listened to this album (I said to myself years ago that I was going to do it). Considering this album is from '66, it have aged really well, the album doesn't sound like the typical Beach Boy style,as always the instrumental tracks where my favorites, I'll be listening to more 60's music and bands inspired by The Beach Boys.

18. [Los Prisioneros - Corazones](https://www.last.fm/music/Los+Prisioneros/Corazones)

    "Tren Al Sur" and "Estrechez De Corazón" are anachronic hits from latin american rock, maybe all of you will agree with me that either (or both) songs deserve a spot in the top 10 of spanish rock music from all time.

    But damn, "that rap song" was trash, it ruined the album for me, I didn't have a good experience listening to it, also because many songs from the album felt subpar, maybe because those two hits overshadow the rest. But I don't think I will ever listen to this album again. Ok, "Noche en la ciudad" had good sound and lyrics, but beside that nothing else is redeemable.
